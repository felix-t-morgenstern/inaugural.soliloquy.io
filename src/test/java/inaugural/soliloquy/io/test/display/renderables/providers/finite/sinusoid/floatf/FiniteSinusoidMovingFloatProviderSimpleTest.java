/**
 * Test acceptance criteria:
 *
 * 1. This test will display a window of 1920x1080 pixels in the middle of the screen for 3000ms
 * with a titlebar reading "My title bar". The window will contain a picture of a shield,
 * centered in the window, taking up half of the width and three-fourths of the height of the
 * window.
 * 2. At first, there should be no (or next-to-no border). Over the first 4000ms, a purple border
 * will grow around the shield, slowly at first, then quicker, then more slowly towards the end.
 * Over the last 4000ms, the border will recede; at first, it will recede more slowly than it
 * accreted; then, in the middle, it will recede more quickly than it had accreted in the middle;
 * lastly, it will recede more slowly than it had accreted at the end.
 * 3. The window will then close.
